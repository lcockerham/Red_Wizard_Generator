# Red_Wizard_Generator
Randomly generate Red Wizards of Thay. Written using ChatGPT. 

Work in progress. Eventually I want it to generate a full NPC stat block for a Red Wizard of Thay, should look like Azbara Jos (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17467-azbara-jos).

Everything is written in python. Dependencies are obvious, I may add a more mature build guide and process depending on how far I take the project.
